        <h2>It's a Wonderful Life</h2>
        <p>
            One of my favorite films of all time is Frank Capra's 
            <strong>It's a Wonderful Life</strong> (1946). I deeply admire 
            this film because of its heartfelt message, its stellar acting,
            and its raw portrayal of a struggling man's emotions.

            </a>
            you can find one of the most visceral and emotional scenes.

        <h2>Silence</h2>
        <p>
            One my favorite films is Martin Scorcese's 
            <strong>Silence</strong> (2016). I find this film fascinating
            for the themes it presents, its meditative and thoughful pace,
            and lastly its profoundness.

        <h2>Spider-Man 2</h2>
        <p>
            One of my favorite films is Sam Raimi's 
            <strong>Spider-Man 2</strong> (2004). I enjoy this film because
            of its charm and humor, a compelling look at what it means to 
            be a superhero, and its humanity.
